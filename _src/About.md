## Coding is _O.K._

This blog aims to provide intermediate-level programming resources. We assume
that readers know what for-loops are, but we don't assume that programmers
know what "monading a reciprocal contrafunctor" means (we made that up, it
doesn't mean anything).

## Why

In learning programming, we found that most learning resources are bimodal --
either they assume that the reader knows literally nothing (hence, we didn't
really learn anything out of frustration), or they assume that the reader
knows a lot (hence, we didn't really learn anything out of frustration).

Sometimes you know a good amount about how to write programs, but you don't
really know the ins-and-outs of particular techniques. There are tons of books
which explain interfaces/abstract classes/classes, but those interest
calculator projects don't really teach you when you should use one of those
things over the others -- nor _why_.

And so here we are. Hopefully this will come in handy.
