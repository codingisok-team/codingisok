# Resources

## General Programming Help
### Python Tutor
   [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) provides a visual representation 
of how a computer steps through any code the user inputs. Despite the name, 
Python Tutor has a visualizer for not only `python`, but `java`, `c`, `c++`, 
`javascript`, and `ruby`.

### `printf` cheat sheet
   `printf` is a common method used in `c`, `c++`, and `java`, but its format 
specifiers can be hard to remember. Luckily, there's a 
[cheat sheet](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs160/.Summer16/resources/Java_printf_method_quick_reference.pdf) 
for it. If you want a more verbose explanation of `printf`, you might like [this 
paper](http://www.cypress.com/file/54441/download).

## `vim`
### `vimtutor`
   a program probably already located on your computer, `vimtutor` guides the user 
through a basic interactive vim tutorial and can be accessed by either running
`vimtutor` in a terminal or opening the lesson file found [here](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/vimtutor) 
in `vim`. Note that `vimtutor` by default creates a copy of the lesson file when
run, so any changes made to the file while following the tutorial will not be 
permanent. Contrarily, editing the lesson file directly in `vim` will change the 
source file, so you might want to make a copy first.

### openvim
    If you want a more user-friendly and forgiving introduction to `vim`, check 
out [openvim](https://www.openvim.com/). This tutorial will guide you through 
a gentle interactive introduction to basic vim commands without the hassle of 
dealing with the terminal. Additionally, there is a "Practice" tab which gives 
you a text sandbox and a small cheat sheet of commands so you can try out what 
you learned in the tutorial. Unfortunately, the "Practice" tab doesn't have `u` 
(undo) implemented, so if you want to go back or start over, you'll have to 
reload the page. 

### `vim` cheat sheet
    If you already feel comfortable with some basic `vim` commands, 
[here's](http://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html) 
a helpful cheat sheet that organizes all the most common `vim` commands in one 
easy-to-parse place.

### `vim` wiki
    Need even more `vim`? The [`vim` wiki's](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Usage) 
got you covered. 

## Markdown
### Markdown Guide
   [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) is a comprehensive 
guide to the Markdown markup language. Not only does it introduce Markdown, it 
also provides explanations for both basic and extended syntax, as well as a 
cheat sheet. 

## Regex
### RegExr
   [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) is a verbose, user-friendly sandbox for trying 
and testing regexes. It even has a cheat sheet and a reference tab on the left 
side of the page in case you need to look up any syntax. If you only know what 
a regex is but don't know how to write one, that's ok too; RegExr is verbose and 
highly transparent in how it interprets the regexes you write. 

### regex 101
  [regex 101](https://regex101.com/) is similar to RegExr but somewhat less 
beginner-friendly. However, it does contain a regex debugger which breaks down 
how a regex interpreter parses and pattern matches your regex step by step.

### Regex tutorial
  If you have no idea what a regex is or what any of what the symbols mean, 
[here's](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285) 
a good, clear introduction to what regexes are, how to write them, and what they 
can be used for.

## `ruby`
### why's [poignant] guide to `ruby`
  If you want an introduction to ruby (or programming in general) but wish that 
programming resources were written by Douglas Adams, then [the poignant guide](https://poignant.guide/) 
is for you. If why's rambling's end up being too much for you, why has also 
compiled a [list of more traditional `ruby` resources](https://poignant.guide/book/).
