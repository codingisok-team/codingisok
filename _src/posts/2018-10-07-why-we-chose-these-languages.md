    Title: Why We Chose These Languages

We want this site to be a useful resource, therefore we've chosen four common
programming languages to focus on: `c`, `c++`, `java`, and `python`.

These languages range in complexity and the amount of control the programmer
has over the inner workings of the computer -- `c` assumes the programmer knows
exactly what they're doing at all times and provides no safety vs. `python`
which provide more safeguards to prevent you from (worst case) deleting your
entire hard drive. `c++` and `java` fall somewhere in between these two extremes.

Altogether, these four languages exemplify different programming paradigms, and
we found them useful for illustrating most of the concepts a programmer
encounters day-to-day.

## `c`

`c` is the famous parent of modern programming languages. There are plenty of
languages which are older than `c` --  including some which are still used
today -- but they're generally found in more niche areas, being written for
specialized applications. Examples include `Fortran` (used in scientific
applications), `lisp` (commonly found in academia), etc. For whatever
reason,`c` is the language which stuck around, and you'll often see it used in
systems programming (e.g. writing an operating system or a graphics program).

### Conclusion

`c` (and its shortcomings) have prompted people to write new languages in order
to add safety nets and improve code readability. One direct example is `c++`.

## `c++`

`c++` was originally known as "`c` with classes."
