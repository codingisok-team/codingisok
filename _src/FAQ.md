# F.A.Q.

## Who are you anyway?
Dan (they/them) is a professional software engineer who is frustrated with the industry and Linnea (she/her) is building programming self-confidence. You can find more of Dan's stuff [here](https://barel.la/blog) and more of Linnea's stuff [here](https://linneakirby.com) and [here](cirqueit.info).

## How does this work?
Basically, Linnea brings topics to Dan; Dan explains said topics to Linnea. They then work together to write an extensive and (hopefully) clear and useful post on the topic. There is no particular order in how topics are chosen other than Linnea's whims (a.k.a. something wasn't explained well online and she wanted a better explanation). However, we try to tag posts with useful category tags so if there's a post in a category you're looking for, you should be able to find it!

## Will your examples actually be useful?
Hopefully! We've gotten pretty annoyed with most examples that we've seen in instructional material so we've tried to make our examples as clear as possible. Our philosophy on examples is that it should be easy to tell what is necessary for the syntax and what are just dummy variables that we've put in for the sake of the example. We also don't think it's generally useful when examples use print statements to show that the example did something, so our examples assume that a `main` method will handle any output.

## What do `<these_things>` mean in the examples?
We try to have as few placeholder values in our examples as possible for clarity's sake, but any time we need to add a placeholder (such as for unknown user input), we will put it in pointy brackets, like this: `<placeholder>`.

## Why did you choose these particular programming languages?

In our opinion, programming in `c`, `c++`, `python`, and `java` covers a wide range of
language paradigms which programmers regularly deal with.

`c` is a foundational language, while `java`, `python`, and `c++` are some of
the most widespread modern languages.

While `java` and `python` accomplish mostly the same thing, the style of coding
is very different -- `java` forces an object-oriented programming style, whereas
`python` is less rigidly structured.

On top of that, `c++`, spans the gap between `c` and `java`, requiring the
programmer to consciously choose features of each language. In order to show the
reasoning behind choosing one coding style over another, we use `c++` because
it lets us illustrate various approaches side-by-side.

## What's with the pronouns?
That's not really relevant to this blog or what we're trying to do at all but [here's a good article](https://www.mypronouns.org/sharing/) that might answer your question. 

P.S. Before you start thinking that singular they is "incorrect grammar," might we point out that [the dictionary disagrees](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they).

## What does "lan-party" mean?

It's both a play on our names (Linnea + Dan -> lan) and a reference to
computer [LAN parties](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party). We think it's
cute.

## Why did you use "O.K." instead of "okay"?
Good question. [Here's a good answer.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-hilarious-history-of-ok-okay)
